# Energy Efficiency Classification Analysis

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to classify building energy efficiency (heating and cooling loads) based on architectural features. The goal is to predict whether a building will have Low, Medium, or High energy requirements.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: EDA with correlation heatmaps
- **Classification Models**: Decision Tree and Random Forest
- **Performance**: 98.96% accuracy achieved
- **Techniques**: Feature scaling, binning, model evaluation

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Classification algorithms
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Energy efficiency analysis

## Results
The Random Forest classifier achieved 98.96% accuracy in predicting heating load classes, demonstrating strong predictive capability for building energy efficiency.
